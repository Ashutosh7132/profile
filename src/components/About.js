      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience in creating 
        digital experiences that combine beautiful design with robust functionality. 
        I specialize in React, Node.js, and modern web technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to 
        open-source projects, or enjoying the great outdoors. I believe in continuous 
        learning and always strive to write clean, maintainable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to build applications that not only look great but also provide 
        exceptional user experiences and solve real-world problems.
